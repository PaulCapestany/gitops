Thank you for installing the bitiq chart!

This chart deploys multiple services defined in the values files.

To check the deployed services:
  kubectl get svc,deploy,ing -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release-name>

If you configured ingress and DNS, access the services via their defined hostnames.

Rollback is as simple as reverting to a previous commit in your GitOps repo and letting Argo CD sync.
